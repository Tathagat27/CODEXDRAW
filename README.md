# üßëüèª‚Äçüíª Why did I build this?

I built CodexDraw out of a personal struggle. I experienced significant difficulty when trying to discuss coding problems with my friends. Existing tools didn't provide the seamless collaboration and real-time interaction I needed. Recognizing this challenge, I decided to create CodexDraw ‚Äì a platform specifically designed to provide real-time collaboration among programmers by having a collaborative code editor and a whiteboard. The aim is to make coding discussions with friends and peers more accessible, efficient, and enjoyable.
